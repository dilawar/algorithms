Bipolar disorder (BD) is a devastating psychiatric illness characterized by disruptive mood swings; with alteration between mania & depression. Lithium stands out as the go-to drug because of its preventive effect against mania and also for its specific antisuicide effect. Although lithium is still the mainstay in BD treatment, individual response towards lithium is variable- it remains an ineffective course of action for a large proportion of bipolar sufferers- the so-called ‘lithium non-responders’, whereas around 30% of patients are only partially responsive to lithium. However, the mechanism of lithium sensitivity still remains partially understood and there are multiple hypotheses in this regard.

 Studies have shown that the PI cycle is a key intracellular second messenger system in brain- failure to regulate the PI signaling pathway can have devastating consequences on cellular function. One of the widely discussed hypothesis is that lithium affects the hyperactive inositol signaling in the cells by inhibiting Inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) - which is integral to the maintenance of the PI signaling in mammalian cells. The aim of our study is to determine whether perturbing IMPase function induces the beneficial effects of lithium. We plan to revisit the inositol depletion hypothesis via a novel approach using lipid specific fluorescent probes.
